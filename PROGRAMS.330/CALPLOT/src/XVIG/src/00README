08 15 99 - modified color.c from previous distribution to work
	with greater than 8-bit color plane. Tested for
	monochrome, speusocolor (8), trucolor(16,24)
	
	Also note the cursor response in xvig.c should be
	changed when the clipregion includes the entire screen
	As is it now, the response inside the cursor region
	when we use the X11 default arrow is slow!!

02 25 00 - changed the routine my_findpath in init.c to avoid destroying the
	getenv PATH variable
