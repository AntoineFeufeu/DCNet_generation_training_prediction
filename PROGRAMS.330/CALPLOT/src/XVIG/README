The CALPLOT graphics for X11 is based on a modification of
XviG. The original XviG distribution is in ../../../XVIG.

This is a very useful package that was upgraded and modified 
to be compatible with CALPLOT graphics. 

Essential changes were:

1. To permit arrow, XOR line , XOR cross, and XOR line for cursor
2. To use the 35 color CALPLOT color map, and to use dithering if
the 35 colors are not available, e.g., Netscape grabs a lot
at times.
