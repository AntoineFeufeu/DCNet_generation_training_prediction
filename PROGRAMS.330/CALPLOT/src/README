This is the source directory for CALPLOT libraries
and executables.

NOTE: All files here are in UNIX text format. This means that when
the cmd cmd.ms cmd.tc flib flib.ms clib clib.tc clib.ms and include
are moved to an MS-DOS machine, that the proper conversion routines be used to
convert LF -> LF CR

The reason that there is not a separate src directory structure in 
CALPLOT.PC is that the sources are common to all architectures.

XVIG/         - libraries for XviG X11 interface
clib/         - sources for all libraries for C compilers
clib.ms/      - just contains makefile for MS C5.1 and gets
                  everything from clib include and cmd
clib.tc/      - this is for Turbo C++ 3.0
clib.unx/     - this is for Unix
cmd/          - sources for all commands
cmd.ms/       - Makefile for MSC5.1
cmd.tc/       - Makefile for TC++ 3.0
cmd.unx/      - Makefile for Unix
flib/         - sources for all libraries for Fortran 77 Compilers
flib.ms/      - makefile for MS Fortran 4.0
flib.unx/     - makefile for f77
include/

Compile Procedure:

1. cd XVIG/src
   Edit Makefile.std

   make -f Makefile.std  all

   This will place the library xvig.a in NPROGRAMS/lib and the executable
   xvig in NPROGRAMS/bin

2. cd ../../
   This returns you to NPROGRAMS/CALPLOT/src

3. cd clib.unx  (for a UNIX machinee)
   Edit Makefile

   make docp    (this copies all sources to this current directory,
		compiles and installs the fortran libraries)

4. cd .. 
   This returns you to NPROGRAMS/CALPLOT/src

5. cd flib.unx  (for a UNIX machinee)
   Edit Makefile

   make docp    (this copies all sources to this current directory,
		compiles and installs the fortran libraries)

6. cd .. 
   This returns you to NPROGRAMS/CALPLOT/src

7. cd testf.unx
   Edit Makefile

   make all   - this creates the test programs to test X11 interactive graphics
		from FORTRAN

8. cd .. 
   This returns you to NPROGRAMS/CALPLOT/src

9. cd testc.unx
   Edit Makefile

   make all   - this creates the test programs to test X11 interactive graphics
		from FORTRAN

10. The test programs that create the CALPLOT plotfiles are in
    NPROGRAMS/CALPLOT/ftest.unx and NPROGRAMS/CALPLOT/ctest.unx
