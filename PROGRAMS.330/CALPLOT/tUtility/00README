This directory contains general purpose programs
using the CALPLOT libraries.

CALPLT.f is an interactive program providing much of the functionality
of the CALPLOT libraries without the need to program.

CALPLT -V
invokes a more interactive version, in which each invocation of
a command is accompanied by a one-line help syntax.

For example

 Enter command
NEWPEN                         - define the pen color
 NEWPEN:ipen
2                              - pen color 2 is red
 Enter command
BOX
 BOX:xl,yl,xu,yu,string,ht
1.0 1.0 5.0 5.0 'hello' 0.10  - draw a box and place the string hello within
 Enter command
PEND                          - edn the plot

The CALPLOT file CALPLT.PLT is created as well as the command
summary CALPLT.cmd, which can be edited by hand and run
as

cp CALPLT.cmd C
CALPLT < C

Here is CALPLT.cmd

NEWPEN

BOX                 
  1.  1.  5.  5. 'hello'   .100000001
