for do_pom and do_mft  make heirarchy of routines

Ensure that mftdsp is not inadvertantly free'd else I get junk


main
	do_page1
		do_page2
			do_page3
				do_page4
					do_start
						get_mft_output
							mftdsp=calloc
					get_action
						do_matchprep
					get_action1
						doout1 - output to PMF

-----------
pom96 - clean up do_pom4 to get rid of menu for MATCH etc

FOR sacmft96 - be very careful about the phase
for interstation green's functions
Do I really want to use observations at negative time????
If this the cause for the funny phase velocity curves???
