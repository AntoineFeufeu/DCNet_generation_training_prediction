Rdseed Version 5.2 

	This is the SEED reader program as distributed by the IRIS DMC.
	The version will read SEED volumes up to version 2.4

	The distribution includes all sources needed for compiling for the 
	host computer.

	The current version is developed for the Sun computer, but should be
	compatible for other UNIX systems as well.

	As of version 5.2 rdseed now runs on Windows PC utilizing CYGWIN 
	technologies. For information on downloading the CGYWIN tools go to
	www.cygwin.com and download the most recent version of the DLL. You will
	also need to download the gcc and make tools if you wish to compile rdseed.
	rdseed also requires the "more" utility, found as of this writing at:
		http://cygwin.com/packages/util-linux/

	You will need to run rdseed within the CYGWIN shell.
	
	
Installation:
	
	program name: rdseed

	Use the tar command to "extract" binary and sources, i.e:
		tar -xvf rdseed.tar .

	(You already must have done this in order to be reading this now)

	This will yield a top level directory named rdseed with
	an executable, along with other miscellaneous files.

	The C source files are located in the sub-directories.


	As distributed there are five excutables. They are:

		rdseed.mac.x86_64            -- for Mac on an Intel platform
		rdseed.rh6.linux_64          -- for Red Hat version 6 on an Intel platform
		rdseed.solaris.sparc_64      -- for Solaris running on a Sun/Sparc platform
		rdseed.solaris.x86_64        -- for Solaris running on a Sun/Intel platform
		rdseed.windows.cygwin_32.exe -- for Cygwin running on Windows 7 (32 bit app only)
	
	To install without "make":
		change directory to rdseed

	If your operating system is Windows, Mac OSX, Linux or Solaris, move the appropriate file a directory 
	in your path, perhaps renaming it to rdseed.  For example, if your operating system is Linux and you 
	want to put it in /usr/local/bin, the command would be:
		 cp -p rdseed.rh6.linux_64 /usr/local/bin/rdseed 

	assuming you have write permission to that directory.

		copy the man pages rdseed.l into the man directory, typically

		/usr/local/man/man1/rdseed.1

	To recompile:	
		change directory to rdseed

		First to make sure we have a "clean" tar version, enter :
			make clean
				at the command line.

		Edit the makefile's LDFLAGS variable to either:

		for Solaris: LDFLAGS = -lm -lc -lnsl

		for Linux, Mac OSX, PC: LDFLAGS = -lm -lc

		Comment out one or the other entry in the makefile as
		is appropriate for your system.

		Then enter:
			make

		at the command line.

		After a few minutes you will have an executable for your 
		machine.
	
		Again, copy executable into your path, plus add the man page to
		your man page directory as described above.

	32 bit systems:

		Since version 5.0 of rdseed, all of the released executables have been 64-bit binaries.  
		This will cause problems on older 32-bit systems, which will report a 'bad executable' 
		error or report a 'wrong CPU type'.  This is necessary to support some of rdseed's newer 
		features and rdseed running as a 32-bit application may experience some limitations when 
		processing large datasets.

		Nonetheless, you can recompile rdseed as a 32-bit application and get reliable functionality 
		equivalent to versions 4.8 and earlier.  There is a makefile in the distribution where you 
		uncomment the CFLAGS line to force 32-bit compilation:

		#CFLAGS = -O -m32 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE

		Uncomment this by removing the hash mark, then save the makefile and type:

		make clean
		make

		The executable is named 'rdseed' by default and should now be executable on 32-bit systems.
