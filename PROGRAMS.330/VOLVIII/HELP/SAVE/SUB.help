SUMMARY:
Subtract a constant to  all SAC data files in  memory.

SUB [v], 

INPUT:
       [v] : constant to be subtracted to all files

SAC COMPATIBILITY:
       SAC permits an extended syntax that permits applying different constants
       to respective files in memory. We have not implemented this complexity.
