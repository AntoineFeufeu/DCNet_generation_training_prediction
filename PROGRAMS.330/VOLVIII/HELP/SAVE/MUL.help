GSAC Command Reference Manual                                     MUL

SUMMARY:
Multiply  all SAC data files in  memory by a constant.

MUL [v], 

INPUT:
       [v] : constant by which all  files are multiplied

SAC COMPATIBILITY:
       SAC permits an extended syntax that permits applying different constants
       to respective files in memory. We have not implemented this complexity.
DEFAULT
       DIV 1
