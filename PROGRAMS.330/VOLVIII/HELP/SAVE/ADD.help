GSAC Command Reference Manual                                     ADD

SUMMARY:
Add a constant to  all SAC data files in  memory.

ADD [v], 

INPUT:
       [v] : constant to be added to all files

SAC COMPATIBILITY:
       SAC permits an extended syntax that permits applying different constants
       to respective files in memory. We have not implemented this complexity.
