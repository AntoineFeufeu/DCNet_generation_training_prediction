WRITE - OK currently WRITE works as follows

	WRITE - overwrites those in memory
	WRITE 1 2 3
		write output in order of memory as 1 2 3
		else complains if there are not three in memory

	To implement prepend append or prefix suffix (prefix is hard because of absolute path - more parsing work

	perhaps add a verbose operator to say what is actually written
	usefile if we do a filelist - e.g., 
	1234 -> A   to show what the original is renamed as
