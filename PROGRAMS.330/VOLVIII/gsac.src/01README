Note check to see if cut takes arguments such as o gmt

FG shoudl remove everything from memory and start anew DONE
currently it used dregs in memory
	why doesn't PSP plot the spectra the first time
	what is wrong with the axes om the flog plot?

stangeness in display - the the max time correcely reset

-------
CUT - when trying to put in the GMT and CAL, we must be very careful to
skip those entries in the desac routine
------
do XLIM gsac_plot calls gsac_exec_doxlim to set everything up - so simple?
-----
	for crossnoise whitening - may work better using segments since
	then the teleseism is actually proportionately weighted down

WHITEN could have freq limits? as in bandpass
