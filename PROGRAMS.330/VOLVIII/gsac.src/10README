fg comb
a little strange when do a 

fg delta 0.25 npts 4096 comb 10 0.5 - do look give a little larger at end
else would get trapezoid/boxcar

Also do normailization by a straight sum afterwords

When I do an ISYNC to O I should set the enumerated header value IZTYPE as IO instead of IB or IUNKN

since spectra series are introduced perhaps now introduce xlog

Thoughts in the IXY for the spectra -
	look carefully at the use of absolute relative for the the
	ixy filed type - relative has no use whatsoever

	look carefully at the ppk l option - basically little of the time picking should be permitted
