	note I use black for the axes and I plot inside the box. So if the 
	color is 1, e.g., black, then I do not see the tics
	If the color is 2, then I do not see the first traces if I use color rainbow
	So must be careful in the newpen calls when plotting

for psppk smooth option , we must actually form the y array smoothed
before outputting everything
